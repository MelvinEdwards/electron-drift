            I am a PhD student at Wayne State University in Detroit Michigan USA. 
            My research focuses on the implementation of various artificial neural 
            networks on-chip in the analog domain. The primary focus is edge 
            applications for IoT. My research also focuses heavily on mixed signal 
            CMOS design to accomplish this task. I have extensive experience with 
            Python, MATLAB, and C++ coding. I am experienced with the applications of 
            DNNs, CNNs, RNNs, and combinations of these architectures to successfully 
            model the underlying statistical distribution of a given dataset. I also 
            have extensive experience in the automotive industry with much of my 
            knowledge on lab equipment and spectral analysis.
